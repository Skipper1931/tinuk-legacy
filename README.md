**Tinuk**

*Please note that the most recent version of the kernel source is in the "develop" branch*

Tinuk is a kernel and OS I'm developing as a hobby project to learn about operating systems, hardware, and just to generally have fun.

The codebase in its current (at the time of this file's creation) state mostly made up of the ["Meaty Skeleton" tutorial on the OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton). As time goes on I hope to expand the kernel and make it more of my own.
